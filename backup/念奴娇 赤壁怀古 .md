The river rolls on eastward, waves worn down,
Legends of ancient heroes, all renown.
West of the old fortress, tales ring,
Of the Three Kingdoms, where Zhou’s victory did sing.

Stones clutter the shore, to the sky they appear to prick,
Giant waves crash against them, creating a snowy trick.
The vast scenic land, like a painting so thick,
Bursting with a multitude of heroes, quick.

Recalling Zhou Yu in his prime,
His new bride, Xiaoqiao, a beauty so divine.
With feather fan and silk cap, a figure so fine,
Laughing as he scorched the enemy's ships, a victorious line.

Now I wander the ancient battlefield, in the past I delve,
Mocked for my sentimentality, prematurely silver-haired myself.
Life's but a dream, to the river and moon, a toast we shelve,
In honor of the eternal heroes, in our hearts, they dwell.


大江东去，浪淘尽，千古风流人物。
故垒西边，人道是，三国周郎赤壁。

乱石穿空，惊涛拍岸，卷起千堆雪。
江山如画，一时多少豪杰。

遥想公瑾当年，小乔初嫁了，雄姿英发。
羽扇纶巾，谈笑间，樯橹灰飞烟灭。

故国神游，多情应笑我，早生华发。
人生如梦，一尊还酹江月。
